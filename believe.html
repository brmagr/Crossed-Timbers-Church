	<h5><span >Who is Jesus?</span></h5>
<p>Jesus is the son of God, born of a virgin, crucified on a cross, died to pay for our sins, rose from the grave, ascended into heaven, and will return. "16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him (John 3:16,17)."</p>
	<h5><span >What is the Bible?</span></h5>
	<p>The Bible is the inspired Word of God and our instructions for life on earth providing answers and guidance for everyone in every situation. "16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, (II Timothy 3:16)"</p>
	<h5><span>How are sinners saved?</span></h5>
	<p>Believe "16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned (Mark 16:16)." Confess "9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved (Romans 10:9-10)." Repent "38 Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).'" Be Baptized "16 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.’ (Acts 22:16)" Obedience "21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. (Matthew 7:21)"</p>

			<h5><span>Who are followers of Christ?</span></h5>
			<p>Followers of Christ emulate the teachings and example of their leader, Jesus. "30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] There is no commandment greater than these.” (Mark 12:30-31)"</p>
			<h5><span>Why do we have a church body?</span><h5>
			<p>The church is a body of believers formed to love and encourage one another to spread His love throughout the community. "5 so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others (Romans 12:5)." "19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age (Matthew 28:19-20)."</p>
			<h5><span>Who is God?</span></h5>
			<p>God exists, created us, loves us, provides for us, and most importantly sent His son to save us. He is the one and only GOD! "5 I am the Lord, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me (Isaiah 45:5)."</p>
